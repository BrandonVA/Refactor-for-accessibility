# Title
Horiseon Social Solutions 

# Overview

This is a web page that will be refactored using semantic html elements and some aria tags. This should help the webpage be more accessible and be better suited for search engine optimization, web crawlers, and screen readers.

# Conclusion

 I also cleaned up the css and html to be more readable, slightly increased the font size and changed some font colors to have better contrast for visual impared users.
